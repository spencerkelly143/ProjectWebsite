  'desc': "Innoventure is the brainchild of Western University. Their vision was to connect small-to-medium sized enterprises with international investors. Western Partnered with Queen's and the Centre for Advanced Computing to make this happen.\n I was the first of two developers assigned to this 5 month long project. I was responsible for creating the front-end design and functionality of the website while the other junior developer was responsible for developing the backend. This website was developed using react and nodejs with a MongoDb database.\n Challenges included designing the website to be completely scalable and catering to the clients desire for an array of different fields. By the end of the project, the user had the ability to fill in information to 137 different fields and securely save that onto the database."},
